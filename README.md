Subtle tweaks designed for efficiency.

### Requirements

- macOS 10.15 Catalina or above

## Install with Sketch Runner

With Sketch Runner, just go to the `Install` command and search for `Tweaks`. Runner allows you to manage plugins and do much more to speed up your workflow in Sketch. [Download Runner here](http://www.sketchrunner.com).

> Tweaks is a spinoff from the [Midnight](https://midnightsketch.com) plugin, which included some of the same features under its _Advanced Features_ section.

# Features

## Indent Guides

Indent Guides give you a better overview of how your nested layers and symbols are structured.

Right-click a layer, group, or page to add a color tag.

You can also filter the layer list by tags, making it easy to search for tagged layers.

## Collapse Groups

A simple button, perfectly positioned above the layer list to help you perform the frequent action of collapsing all groups in your document.

Hint: Option+Click the button to collapse all artboards and groups except the layers you have selected.

### Vector Handles

The default handles for vector editing are a tad difficult to see on gray backgrounds. Tweaks replaces those handles with high-contrast handles that are clearly visible on all backgrounds.

### Save Locally

Save Locally adds an option in the File Menu to directly show the standard Save dialog for saving documents locally. This lets you skip the 3-step process of saving new files to you Mac if you're not using Sketch Cloud.
